\section*{Problem 3}

Consider a 1000 MWE reactor with a 33\% efficiency conversion from MWT to MWE. 
What is the minimum volume of UO$_2$, enriched to 3 (atom) \% $^{235}$U that could theoretically supply the yearly energy production of this reactor. 
Treat energy contributions as coming only from the fission of $^{235}$U. 
These fission events release about 200 MeV with 95\% of that energy staying in the reactor.
