\section*{Problem 2}

Free neutrons undergo $\beta^{-}$ decay with a half-life of 10.4 minutes. 
Determine the probability that a neutron will decay before being absorbed in an infinite absorbing material (assume no scattering). 
Estimate this probability for a thermal neutron ($v = 2200$ m/s) in water.
