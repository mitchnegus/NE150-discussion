\section*{Problem 2}

Consider an infinite slab of material described by diffusion coefficient $D$ and macroscopic cross section $\Sigma_a$. 
The material extends infinitely in two dimensions, but has vacuum boundaries at $x=\pm a$.
Inside the slab is a uniformly distributed source with strength $s'''$ [neutrons per volume]. 
Find the flux in this geometry. 
(You may use the substitution $L = \sqrt{\frac{D}{\Sigma_a}}$.)
