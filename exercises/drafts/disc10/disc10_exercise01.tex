\section*{Problem 1}

Consider an infinite slab of material described by diffusion coefficient $D$ and macroscopic cross section $\Sigma_a$. 
The material extends infinitely in two dimensions, but has a vacuum boundaries at $x=a$ and $x=0$. 
At $x=0$ there is also a uniformly distributed source plane with strength $s''$ [neutrons per area]. 
Find the flux in this geometry. 
(You may use the substitution $L = \sqrt{\frac{D}{\Sigma_a}}$.)
