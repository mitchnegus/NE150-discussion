%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Problem 1}

A reactor contains 5\% (by atom) enriched uranium dioxide, which is 15\% of the entire core by volume.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Calculate the macroscopic cross section for this core if we were to treat it as a homogeneous volume. 
\item If the reactor were a cube with a side length of 4 m and a beam of $10^{15}$ thermal neutrons were incident on one face of the cube, how many neutrons would we expect to make it through to the other side?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 2}

A neutron beam with an intensity of $2 \times 10^{12}\text{ neutrons/(cm}^2{\cdot}\text{s)}$ is incident on an unknown shielding material and has a beam spot of 5 cm$^2$. The shielding material has a thickness of 10 cm.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item On average, $3.0\times10^9$ neutrons/s make it through the shield uncollided. What is the macroscopic cross section of the shield material?
\item What is the mean free path of a neutron in the shielding material?
\item If a single beam pulse is 10 $\mu$s, how many collisions are expected to take place in the shielding material?
\end{enumerate}
