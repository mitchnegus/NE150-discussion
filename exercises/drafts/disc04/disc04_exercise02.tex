\section*{Problem 2}

A neutron beam with an intensity of $2 \times 10^{12}\text{ neutrons/(cm}^2{\cdot}\text{s)}$ is incident on an unknown shielding material and has a beam spot of 5 cm$^2$. The shielding material has a thickness of 10 cm.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item On average, $3.0\times10^9$ neutrons/s make it through the shield uncollided. What is the macroscopic cross section of the shield material?
\item What is the mean free path of a neutron in the shielding material?
\item If a single beam pulse is 10 $\mu$s, how many collisions are expected to take place in the shielding material?
\end{enumerate}
