\section*{Problem 1}

A reactor contains 5\% (by atom) enriched uranium dioxide, which is 15\% of the entire core by volume.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Calculate the macroscopic cross section for this core if we were to treat it as a homogeneous volume. 
\item If the reactor were a cube with a side length of 4 m and a beam of $10^{15}$ thermal neutrons were incident on one face of the cube, how many neutrons would we expect to make it through to the other side?
\end{enumerate}
