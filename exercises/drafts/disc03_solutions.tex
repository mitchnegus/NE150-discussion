\section*{Problem 1}

A reactor is operating for a long time at some known power density $P_0$. Then, it instantaneously changes power to some power density $P_1$. One fission product of interest is $^{135}$Xe, though it has a neglible yield from the initial fission reaction. $^{135}$Xe precursors $^{135}$Te and $^{135}$I are produced with a combined yield of approximately 6\%, before decaying via $\beta^{-}$ decay to $^{135}$I and $^{135}$Xe respectively. Find the number density of $^{135}$Xe as a function of time after the power change. Let $Q_f$ be the energy produced per fission, approximately $200$ MeV.

			$^{135}$Xe	&  $9.2$ hr 	& $2.6 \times 10^6$ barns \\

\section*{Problem 1 Solution}

We will create the following simple decay chain graphic, built from the information provided in the problem, to visualize the processes described in the problem.

Starting off, since this is a problem related to decay, we will start from the usual equation for changes in a quantity of radionuclides.

$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = \text{production} - \text{losses} $$

First, we find the neutron production. We are told that after the transition, the reactor is now generating with power density $P_1$. 

The amount of $^{135}$Xe is dependent on its parents, $^{135}$Te and $^{135}$I. Since the half-life of $^{135}$Te (19.0 s) is practically insignificant in comparison to the multi-hour half-lives of its daughters (to be exact, $T_{\nicefrac{1}{2},\text{Te135}} = 0.08\,T_{\nicefrac{1}{2},\text{I135}}$ and $T_{\nicefrac{1}{2},\text{Te135}} = 0.06\,T_{\nicefrac{1}{2},\text{Xe135}}$), we can treat it as instantaneously decaying into iodine.

Now, we can recognize ...
