\section*{Problem 2}

Three unknown fission products $A$, $B$ and $C$ are produced by a reactor. 
$B$ is stable and has a very large absorption cross section at the energies found in the reactor. 
The population of isotope $B$ is fed by other known fission products. 
Isotope $C$ decays relatively quickly into isotope $A$, which then decays again in short order. 
$C$ has a neglible absorption cross section, while $A$'s cross section is large. 

For each isotope, plot the behavior of the isotope's concentration after the reactor is turned on, left for a long time, then first dropped to some non-zero power, and finally shut-down.
