\section*{Problem}

A reactor is operating for a long time at some known power density $P_0$. Then, it instantaneously changes power to some power density $P_1$. One fission product of interest is $^{135}$Xe, though it has a neglible yield from the initial fission reaction. $^{135}$Xe precursors $^{135}$Te and $^{135}$I are produced with a combined yield of approximately 6\%, before decaying via $\beta^{-}$ decay to $^{135}$I and $^{135}$Xe respectively. Find the number density of $^{135}$Xe as a function of time after the power change. (Your solution may be left as variables)

			Nucleus		&	Half-life 	& Thermal $\sigma_{\text{a}}$ \\
			\hline
			$^{135}$Te	&  $19.0$ s 	& $\sim 0$\\
			$^{135}$I	&  $6.6$ hr 	& $\sim 0$\\
			$^{135}$Xe	&  $9.2$ hr 	& $2.6 \times 10^6$ barns \\

\textbf{Walkthrough of neutron slowing down}\\
(1) Generate a neutron from fission-neutron energy spectrum\\
(2) Find cross section at that point\\
(3) Determine if more likely to scatter/absorb; choose higher prob ((hopefully scatter))\\
(4) Decrease by average energy loss\\
(5) Repeat steps 2/3 until absorbed\\
Identify interaction points on fission cross section plot... show "skipped resonances"

\section*{Problem}

Recall from mechanics that centripetal force is $F_{\text{cent}} = -\frac{mv^2}{r}$ and recall from E\&M that the Coulombic force is $F_{\text{coul}} = -\frac{Ze^2}{r^2}$. Solve for the Bohr radius of the orbit of an electron on hydrogen, assuming the angular momentum $L = mvr$ is quantized multiples of $\hbar$ ($1\hbar, \; 2\hbar,\; 3\hbar$, etc). Compare this to the measured value of $5.2917721067(12)\times10^{11} \text{\AA}$ , the most probable distance between an electron in the ground state and the nucleus of a hydrogen atom.
