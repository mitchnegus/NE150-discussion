%% LaTeX template prepared by Sami Lewis for students in NE 101/210M, fall 2016
%% NOTES:
%%			- This is a simple, bare-bones template for the purposes of typing up homeworks. 
%%				There are many more advanced things you can add if you wish to do so.
%%			- You can make any changes to the template that you'd like.
%%			- Things in all caps are things you need to fill in. Make sure to change them
%%				all, including your name.
%%			-	There are lots of other, nicer free templates online too!
%%			- Run the template once without making any changes so that you can install
%%				all of the packages and see what the formatting looks like.

\section*{Problem}

A reactor is operating for a long time at some known power density $P_0$. Then, it instantaneously changes power to some power density $P_1$. One fission product of interest is $^{135}$Xe, though it has a neglible yield from the initial fission reaction. $^{135}$Xe precursors $^{135}$Te and $^{135}$I are produced with a combined yield of approximately 6\%, before decaying via $\beta^{-}$ decay to $^{135}$I and $^{135}$Xe respectively. Find the number density of $^{135}$Xe as a function of time after the power change. (Your solution may be left as variables)

			$^{135}$I	&  $6.6$ hr 	& $\sim 0$\\
			$^{135}$Xe	&  $9.2$ hr 	& $2.6 \times 10^6$ barns \\

\section*{Problem}

Recall from mechanics that centripetal force is $F_{\text{cent}} = -\frac{mv^2}{r}$ and recall from E\&M that the Coulombic force is $F_{\text{coul}} = -\frac{Ze^2}{r^2}$. Solve for the Bohr radius of the orbit of an electron on hydrogen, assuming the angular momentum $L = mvr$ is quantized multiples of $\hbar$ ($1\hbar, \; 2\hbar,\; 3\hbar$, etc). Compare this to the measured value of $5.2917721067(12)\times10^{11} \text{\AA}$ , the most probable distance between an electron in the ground state and the nucleus of a hydrogen atom.
