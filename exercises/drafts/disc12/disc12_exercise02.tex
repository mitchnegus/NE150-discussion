\section*{Problem 2}

Consider a bare sphere composed of a homogeneous multiplying medium.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Give the steady-state, continuous energy diffusion equation. Assume that the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and the average neutrons produced from fission ($\nu$) are constant for all energies.
\item Derive the multigroup equation corresponding to the case where there are three energy groups. Assume that there is no upscattering, all groups are directly coupled, and fission is only induced by the slowest group while only producing neutrons in the fastest group.
\item Write the multigroup equation you found as a matrix-equation.
\end{enumerate}
