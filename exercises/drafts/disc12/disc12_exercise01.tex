\section*{Problem 1}

Consider a critical sphere composed of a homogeneous multiplying medium, and surrounded by a reflecting shell of non-multiplying material with a thickness equal to half the radius of the sphere. Outside of the reflector is vacuum.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Write the diffusion equation and boundary conditions describing this system.
\item Calculate the flux in both regions that are not vacuum.
\item Determine the reflector savings.
\end{enumerate}
