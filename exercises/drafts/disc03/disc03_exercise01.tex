\section*{Problem 1}

A reactor is operating for a long time at some known power density $P_0$. 
Then, it instantaneously changes power to some power density $P_1$. 
One fission product of interest is $^{135}$Xe, though it has a neglible yield from the initial fission reaction. 
$^{135}$Xe precursors $^{135}$Te and $^{135}$I are produced with a combined yield, $y$, of approximately 6\%, before decaying via $\beta^{-}$ decay to $^{135}$I and $^{135}$Xe respectively. 
Find the number density of $^{135}$Xe as a function of time after the power change. 
(For convenience, let $Q_f$ be the energy produced in a fission reaction, and let $\phi$ be the flux in the reactor. Your answer may be left in terms of these variables.)
