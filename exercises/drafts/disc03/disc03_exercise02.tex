\section*{Problem 2}

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Find the excitation energy in $^{236}$U when a neutron with zero kinetic energy is absorbed by $^{235}$U. 
\item Find the excitation energy in $^{239}$U when a neutron with zero kinetic energy is absorbed by $^{238}$U. 
\item The activation energy for $^{236}$U is 6.2 MeV and the activation energy for $^{239}$U is 6.6 MeV. Will fission occur in each of these cases? Identify $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U as fissile or fissionable and explain.
\item A $^{238}$U nuclei absorbs a 2 MeV neutron and fissions into $^{132}$Sn, $^{106}$Mo, and a neutron. If the neutron is produced with 2.5\% of the total energy released in the reaction, does it have enough energy to fission another $^{238}$U atom?
