%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Problem 1}

Compute the atomic densities of $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, and O in UO$_2$ when its density is 10.41 g/cm$^3$ and the uranium is enriched to 5 wt\% in $^{235}$U.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Problem 2}

Free neutrons undergo $\beta^{-}$ decay with a half-life of 10.4 minutes. Determine the probability that a neutron will decay before being absorbed in an infinite absorbing material (assume no scattering). Estimate this probability for a thermal neutron ($v = 2200$ m/s) in water.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Problem 3}

A reactor is operating for a long time at some known power density $P_0$. Then, it instantaneously changes power to some power density $P_1$. One fission product of interest is $^{135}$Xe, though it has a neglible yield from the initial fission reaction. $^{135}$Xe precursors $^{135}$Te and $^{135}$I are produced with a combined yield of approximately 6\%, before decaying via $\beta^{-}$ decay to $^{135}$I and $^{135}$Xe respectively. Find the number density of $^{135}$Xe as a function of time after the power change. (Your solution may be left as variables)

			\hline
			Nucleus		&	Half-life 	& Thermal $\sigma_{\text{a}}$ \\
			\hline
			$^{135}$Te	&  $19.0$ s 	& $\sim 0$\\
			$^{135}$I	&  $6.6$ hr 	& $\sim 0$\\
			$^{135}$Xe	&  $9.2$ hr 	& $2.6 \times 10^6$ barns \\

\section*{Problem 4}

Given UO$_2$ with $2.5 \times 10^{21}$ atoms/cm$^3$ of $^{235}$U and $2.0\times10^{22}$ atoms/cm$^3$ of $^{238}$U, find the partial densities of $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, and O, and determine the enrichment.
