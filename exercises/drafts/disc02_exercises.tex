%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Problem 1}

Compute the atomic densities of $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, and O in UO$_2$ when its density is 10.41 g/cm$^3$ and the uranium is enriched to 5 wt\% in $^{235}$U.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Problem 2}

Free neutrons undergo $\beta^{-}$ decay with a half-life of 10.4 minutes. Determine the probability that a neutron will decay before being absorbed in an infinite absorbing material (assume no scattering). Estimate this probability for a thermal neutron ($v = 2200$ m/s) in water.



\newpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Problem 3}

Consider a 1000 MWE reactor with a 33\% efficiency conversion from MWT to MWE. What is the minimum volume of UO$_2$, enriched to 3 (atom) \% $^{235}$U that could theoretically supply the yearly energy production of this reactor. Treat energy contributions as coming only from the fission of $^{235}$U. These fission events release about 200 MeV with 95\% of that energy staying in the reactor.



\newpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Problem 4}

Given UO$_2$ with $2.5 \times 10^{21}$ atoms/cm$^3$ of $^{235}$U and $2.0\times10^{22}$ atoms/cm$^3$ of $^{238}$U, find the partial densities of $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, and O, and determine the enrichment.
