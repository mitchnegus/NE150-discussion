%%				There are many more advanced things you can add if you wish to do so.
%%			- You can make any changes to the template that you'd like.
%%			- Things in all caps are things you need to fill in. Make sure to change them
%%				all, including your name.
%%			-	There are lots of other, nicer free templates online too!
