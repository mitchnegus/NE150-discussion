# Lesson Plan

Course introduction (3 min; 12:10-12:13)

* NE 150, Nuclear Reactor theory
* Cover everything from basic nuclear reactions $\rightarrow$ power outputs of reactors $\rightarrow$ deterministic/stochastic reactor models $\rightarrow$ time dependent reactor operation
* notable course survey results? (not surprising that most are comfortable with 101 stuff)

My Introduction (2 min; 12:13-12:15)
Student Introductions (5 min; 12:15-12:20)

* name
* year
* major/research interests

_I need a spreadsheet to record this_

Discussion section syllabus (10 min; 12:20-12:30)

* Office Hours (10:30-11:30 Wed, 11:06 Etcheverry)
* Discussion is for exploring concepts deeper and resolving confusion $\rightarrow$ some of the big topics that I think would be useful to touch upon from my own experience are (1) solving the neutron diffusion equation in various geometries, (2) developing how the point reactor kinetics equations can be used with the diffusion equation to form a better picture of reactor operation, and (3) how these problems are solved numerically (and active research in their field) 
* **Tip** read before lectures; lecture style
* My policies $\rightarrow$ best is emailâ€“give me 48 hours to respond; won't respond within 24 hours of a deadline (homework, exam, etc.)
* Start applying to RSICC for MCNP (instructions to come)
* No question too simple/dumb; ask away!

Review problems in teams (15 min; 12:30-12:45)

* Identify set of cross sections by isotope
* Radioactive decay
* Calculate binding energy of some nuclei
* Solve second order ODE
* Find probability of collision in wall

Explain problems in teams (10 min; 12:45-12:50)
