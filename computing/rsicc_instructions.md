#### Register

Fill out the [registration form](https://rsicc.ornl.gov/Registration.aspx). You will get a pass number, and should set your password and pin if you don't already have one.

#### Request Software

 Supply remaining info; this will require 

* reading and electronically signing license/export control agreements
* selecting `MCNP6.1/MCNP5/MCNPX-EXE` from the list of available software (note the `-EXE` suffix; licenses are only needed for running the executables, you won't need the source code)
* answer yes to “Is this a student request?”
* provide the following course description

	> Neutron interactions, nuclear fission, chain reactions in thermal and fast nuclear reactors. Diffusion and slowing down of neutrons. Criticality conditions and calculations of critical concentrations, mass and dimensions. Nuclear reactor kinematics and reactivity feedbacks. Production and transmutation of radionuclides in nuclear reactors.

	>This course includes a component where students will use MCNP for performing criticality calculations. Students will write MCNP inputs to simulate simple model reactors and reactor components (homogeneous cores; spherical, cuboid, and/or cylindrical shapes; fuel pins of varying enrichments, etc.). Students will identify critical configurations and determine flux values from simulation output tallies.
