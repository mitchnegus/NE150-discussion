Welcome to the homepage for the discussion section of NE 150, UC Berkeley's introductory course on Nuclear Reactor Theory!
This website contains some [basic info](NE150-Disc_2018_Syllabus.md) about discussion sections, and may be updated with useful resources throughout the semester.

I will do my best to keep [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1468265/files/folder/Discussion%20Section) up-to-date with changes to any and all documents posted on this site, but since this repository will be linked to my own local copy of all files, you can always find the most recent versions of any file here.

Check back often for updates, and good luck!
