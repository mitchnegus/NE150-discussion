Welcome to the homepage for the discussion section of UC Berkeley's introductory course on Nuclear Reactor Theory (NE 150)!
This website contains some [basic info]() about discussion sections, and may be updated with useful resources throughout the semester.

I will do my best to keep bcourses up-to-date with changes to any and all documents posted here, but since this repository will be linked to my own local copy of all files, when in doubt, you can find the most recent versions of any file here.

Check back often for updates, and good luck!
