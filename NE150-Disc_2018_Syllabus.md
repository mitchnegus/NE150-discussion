# Nuclear Engineering 150 Discussion: _Introduction to Nuclear Reactor Theory_

## Overview

### Administrative

Discussion: 

* Group 1 – Wednesday, 12:00-1:00pm, 88 Dwinelle Hall
* Group 2 – Friday, 12:00-1:00pm, 31 Evans Hall

Contact: negus@berkeley.edu

Office Hours: TBD

* discussion section github
* reader's contact

### Topics

The majority of course material will be covered in lecture. Discussion sections will be used to review the material again, ideally in a way that complements what has already been presented. Some points that I specifically hope to address in lecture are: 

- Review of differential equations and their solutions
- 
- Using command line interfaces to perform scientific computing


## Computing Accounts

As per the class syllabus, everoyone enrolled in NE 150 will be provided with an account with DECF (the [Davis-Etcheverry Computing Laboratory](http://www.decf.berkeley.edu/)). DECF provides on-campus computer laboratories in Etcheverry 1111 and 1171, and the DECF computers can also be accessed remotely via [SSH](). More information will be provided regarding how to connect to the DECF computers. 

After the first midterm, we will be using the DECF computers for running MCNP simulations of critical nuclear systems. In order to do this, you will need a license for MCNP, as it is an export controlled software. The license (specifically for MCNP6) is obtained through RSICC ([R... S... I... C... C...](http://rsicc.ornl.gov/Registration.aspx)). My recommendation is that you apply for this license as early as possible to ensure that you have access to the software by the time we reach that point of the semester. I will provide more details about this procedure as we progress. If you have difficulties getting an MCNP license, contact me and we will find a workaround–perhaps using [Serpent]() (a similar, but open-source, code).
